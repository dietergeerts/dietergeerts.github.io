    Dermicus is a platform to help practitioners in treating several conditions
    like wounds and do their follow-up. It has a mobile part to create the case
    and take pictures, and a web part to further work on the case. There is AI
    integration for wound measurements and predicting the diagnosis for moles,
    all indicative and optional.
    
    Implementation-wise, I worked on the web application and cloud backend with
    integrations like Swedish BankID so patients can login for consent purposes.
    Modelling-wise I could expand my HL7 FHIR knowledge, particularly on things
    like questionnaires with population and conditions. Aside from development,
    I also worked on functional analysis of features, meeting customer's needs.

    An open-source library to (de)serialize complex object graphs.
    
    A FE application needs data, and this is often done through requests that
    work with JSON data. Converting this data to/from our JS object can be done
    easily with plain JS, but if you have a lot of these converters, it becomes
    hard to keep consistency and have the code readable. I searched for a lot
    of solutions out there, and only 2 where good, sadly the are geared to the
    use of classes, which isn't done in functional programming. So serializr-fp
    was born to fill the gap.

    The next iteration of my Fabricator Builder, still work in progress though.

    Fabricator Builder is a 'build' tool for creating toolkits. These toolkits
    can help speed up development and be used as styleguide and documentation.
    You can also use such tookits in different projects that needs the same
    styling and frameworks. Think of a toolkit as a small personal bootstrap.

    [Solvice](http://www.solvice.io/) approached us to collaborate with them
    and take over their web application, which demonstrated their optimisation
    service. Their intent was never to create own applications, but invest in
    their optimisation engine, which makes use of [OptaPlanner](https://www.optaplanner.org/), 
    and have applications make use of it. So this is where we stepped in. After 
    assesing the existing demo application, it was clear that it would be too 
    difficult to adapt it further and add new functionality, as it was fastly 
    written purely for demo purposes, so myStaff was born.
  
    We built it from the ground up in a modular way, so new modules can be added
    afterwards easily. The main focus for the first product release is on hospitals, 
    though it's being developed with all kinds of organisations/industries in mind.

    I took on the whole FE part, including UI/UX. One of the goals was to give the
    product it's own distinct look & feel, and make it very user friendly. Together
    with the functional analyst, I also worked on the UX process with the help of
    tools like [Adobe XD](http://www.adobe.com/uk/products/experience-design.html),
    trying to improve the interal UX process in our organisation and working more 
    user oriented for own products.

    I was called to help out with the more difficult parts and mentoring
    the junior software developers, due to my recent experience with the used
    tools.
    
    I always liked to mentor/teach others, and took the lead in this where 
    needed for previous jobs, though it wasn't part of my job description. I
    think it's important as a junior to have a mentor that can help you get
    better faster, growing more confident, teaching you valuable things to 
    improve yourself over time more and more, and maybe be a mentor yourself
    one day.

    Schoolonline wanted a replacement for their existing planner module and add
    extra features to it in the process.  The goal was to have a very user 
    friendly planning module, so teachers can use it to plan their courses, but
    more importantly, administer their content and study books, keep track of
    their yearly goals and have reports generated, as these are required for the
    official plans an are used as proof of the given materials.
     
    I mainly focused on the toolkit, which includes custom components and
    UI/UX styling. We Tried several existing calendar modules out there to see
    if we could use those as a base, but after some research and several 
    prototypes, we concluded that it would be too much work to adapt them to
    our needs, so we created our own calendar, specificly tailored to our needs,
    which took the most development time, to have it as easy as possible.
    
    Together with [mono](https://mono.company/), we worked on the UI and UX part.
    They especially focussed on the analysis and user testing, while we did more
    of the actual implementation, adapting where needed.

    After several years of creating Vectorworks plugins in VectorScript, the
    built-in programming language which really took a lot of Pascal, I switched
    to using python from the moment it was available. This made it possible to
    create plugins more easily, faster, and with a lot more possibilities.

    With the start of creating python based plugins, I also started with
    [DLibrary](https://github.com/dietergeerts/dlibrary), a library for easier
    plugin creation, which hides away all inconsistencies and gotcha's/bugs you
    had to know, as all API calls were copied from the VectorScript language. 
    The first main focus of this library is to have form creation very easy by
    adding an xml layer to visually lay out the form, and using it by adding a
    data layer that then get's coupled with two-way data binding. The second 
    focus was on development experience and to quickly setup a new plugin and 
    all it's behaviours. [DLibrary](https://github.com/dietergeerts/dlibrary) 
    is open-source, and though I'm not active on it anymore, can still be used 
    to create Vectorworks plugins with python. I really hope others can still 
    contribute to it and make it even better.

    I'm not active on it anymore, because I had to stop my business as of
    medical reasons, and it was a very hard decision to make. As I didn't want
    [my plugins](http://www.vectorlab.info/index.php?title=Dieter_Geerts) to go 
    to waste, I put their repositories on public, so everyone can use them, and 
    maybe add some new features.

    During this python period, I had the change to work out some great plugins
    for some customers, putting my skills to use and covering the whole package
    of delivering software from start to finish. I did it all, from project
    management, to the analysis, implementation and delivery. I really learned
    a lot from this and take all of it with me in my further career.

    I would also like to thank the Vectorworks scripting community again. Each
    of them were really great and helpful, and I really enjoyed being around. I
    really believe a great community can make a product so much better, and I
    love helping others, and being helped when needed.

    One of the projects of our Business Analytics division had gotten in a very
    bad state, and the one working on it had to go on sick leave. With no one
    available there, they asked me to take over the project for a very short
    time, as it was already supposed to be ended, and save it.
    
    With no other direct projects, I said yes and stepped up to save it. The
    project was about migrating data from several systems to the new Planon
    system. After the initial data migrition, a continuous one will be setup
    for data that is being administrated in other system, but is needed in
    Planon for use in references.
    
    With all information and development already done in so many places, I
    started to gather it into one central place, using Confluence, so we
    could clearly see the current state and what things should be done. With
    all this in place, we worked out all missing parts in collaboration with
    the client end were able to finish this part of the project.
    
    With this project I had the chance to show off my skills as project manager

    being able to think like a functional analyst makes me a better engineer.

    The client wanted an application to solve a specific problem: The big

    So They wanted an application to work with the data, that would sync
    when the database became available, but stored the data locally on the
    company database when no connection could be made.
    
    We created a simple ASP.NET MVC web application, as all operations

    Our very first product, based on a project we did for a hospital. Being the
    first one also implied a lot of difficulties, especially on transitioning
    from a project based workflow to a product based one. This was also reflected
    on the actual product, behind the scenes, but we learned a lot from it.
    
    The product consists of multiple big parts/modules and was also built in a
    way that extra modules could be added in the future. Besides the product
    itself, we created an integration module for each hospital, as they way
    data is treated and stored is nowhere the same due to historical reasons.
    I was responsible for the toolkit and patient portal, and also helped out
    on the other modules as much as possible.
    
    **Toolkit** - This is a [Fabricator](https://github.com/dietergeerts/fabricator-builder)
    based toolkit where we create all components and styling needed for the 
    various web modules. We also took advantage of this to add documentation
    on why we chose certain stylings and behaviours for getting a user friendly
    UX, as the app would be used by a large group of different types of people.  
    **Kiosk** - This comes with a kiosk hardware and is used for helping
    patients sign in, giving them their ticket and route to their appointment.
    It's built on top of spring webflow, using thymeleaf templates.  
    **Patient Portal** - A web application for patients to make appointments,
    see upcoming ones, check documents and update their data. Patients can log
    in with their eID.  
    **Admin Portal** - This module gives the hospital a way to customize the
    other parts of the product through settings, data management etc....

    [Bayer](http://www.bayer.be/) was in need of an application to support its

    data sets very well and have a web application which can be used on-site. 
    When the application started, Silverlight was the prefered framework at 
    Bayer to write web apps. It was also used because of how it can handle data 
    tables very well in contrast to other web frameworks.
    
    The application is built on the MVVM principle and is using the Telerik UI
    controls. Besides implementing the different xaml views and defining the
    application architecture, I also focussed on styling. Though I did came on
    the project very late in it's lifecycle, there was still lots to refine.

    After finishing school as Master in Building Engineering, I worked some 
    years for architects, doing mainly design and CAD Management. I still
    loved programming and kept doing that in my free time, but decided that I
    really wanted to learn all details of developing an application from begin
    to end, so I started to study again through evening school for Software
    Engineer.
    
    We had the possibility to pick modules in different order and spread them
    out throughough the years, so that we could combine the study with our other
    daily activities. As of that time, I had a full-time job and did sport 
    acrobatics in competition, which took 16 hours of training per week. So I
    opted to only do a few modules each year, taking longer than the average, but
    being able to combine all of this together.
    
    For my thesis, I had chosen to write a web application for architects, as I
    did know that area pretty well. Silverlight was at that time a very good
    chose for the more heavy ones, as it did handle large data sets pretty well.
    I spent a lot of time with the analysis, and wrote up a bunch of storyboards
    before actually starting with development. These storyboards really show that
    I already was into UX, thinking about user-first and how to make up the UI in
    such a way that it would be very user friendly. Not only that, but also my
    analytic capabilities, seeing a good overview of what the application had to
    be and working all parts out step by step.
    
    I really enjoyed doing my thesis, learned a lot from it and imho, a very 
    good start for my career in UI/UX/FE Web Application Engineering.

    I started out as an engineer in construction, mainly working for architects.
    I worked as a designer of buildings, going from small family homes to apartment
    buildings, and this in a BIM way, so both 2D and 3D representations were
    available, as well as all statistics like bill of materials. Besides this
    design work, I also maintained the CAD application, including writing scripts
    for automating the process. With this also came teaching and supporting all
    designers in efficiently working with the software.
